Though Zwan hesitated at first, he eventually agreed to go along with her. While shopping, Vita was on a mission — she was looking for crop tops, but instead of adult sections, she dove straight into the kids' section to check out every single T-shirt there. She kept clicking photos of the outfits she tried in trial room and send to Zwan to check it was good for her. Zwan later always remembered, with a smile, that those photos she took were just like “these ones” — charming, spontaneous, and very much her.

Vita shared that she truly wanted to love someone wholeheartedly, even though her past relationship hadn’t been a pleasant one. She and Zwan often exchanged Instagram reels, and many of the reels she sent were about boyfriend-girlfriend love or husband-wife bonds.

Zwan brought up male ego as a common issue in relationships, to which Vita insightfully responded, “It’s not just male ego — both people shouldn’t carry ego into a relationship.” Vita spoke vulnerably about her longing to be loved, to express love, and to have someone to pour that love into. At the same time, Zwan admitted that he just wanted to love someone — even if it led to a breakup — because he wanted to experience giving and sharing love with someone. He softly concluded, “I think that eventually did happen, right?” He also shared a line from a Hindi movie, Sanam Teri kasam that stayed with him: “Don’t hesitate to say sorry, thank you, and I love you — because we may not get another chance to say these three.”",5/13/2024,Talks About Love,"Love, Relationship, Reels",

His teammates had already started teasing him when he mentioned his plan to go all the way to the bus stop. But he didn’t mind — it was worth it.

He told her that now that she was home — and wouldn’t be as active on Instagram — he’d stay off the app too, at least for a few days. He even said, “If anything, just WhatsApp me.” But as with most things between them — plans changed. Contrary to what Zwan expected, Vita was still available most of the time, though her messages weren’t as frequent as when she was in Chennai. Still, her presence was comforting. One day, Vita sent Zwan a video of her holding a snake, and he almost had a heart attack thinking it was real. She casually mentioned that she was thinking of keeping a snake as a pet — and not just a snake — sometimes even talked about keeping wild animals like elephants. Zwan couldn’t help but scream internally, “AIYYYOOOO!” Fortunately, it turned out to be just a snake toy. As the days passed, they slowly resumed sharing romantic reels. Zwan joked that her Instagram feed must be a factory of love reels, because all he ever got in suggestions now were romantic videos — thanks to her. Zwan found himself sighting her for everything — her voice, her laugh, her smile, and even her messages.

It was a busy time for her at home, but somehow they kept each other looped into their lives. Zwan had his own plans too — he was heading home for his nephew's birthday which was on June 6 2024, and intended to return on June 9 2024. Since Vita had already spent nearly three weeks at home, she initially planned to return to Chennai on the same day with him, and he quietly hoped they’d travel together. But plans shifted. Vita received an invitation to her friend’s wedding on June 12 2024, and so she told Zwan she might not return on June 9 2024 after all due to friend's marriage. Zwan being cool, replied that it was fine and he understood. But inside, he felt a little sad — because he’d been looking forward to traveling with her, sharing those quiet hours and loud laughs in a bus seat beside each other. Even if he didn't say it out loud — he was going to miss her.",5/29/2024,Vita's Time at home,"Instagram, kitKat, Vita's sister's College Admission, Zwan's Nephew's Birthday",
