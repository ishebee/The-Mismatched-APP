Though Zwan hesitated at first, he eventually agreed to go along with her. While shopping, Vita was on a mission — she was looking for crop tops, but instead of adult sections, she dove straight into the kids' section to check out every single T-shirt there. She kept clicking photos of the outfits she tried in trial room and send to Zwan to check it was good for her.

Vita shared that she truly wanted to love someone wholeheartedly, even though her past relationship hadn’t been a pleasant one. She and Zwan often exchanged Instagram reels, and many of the reels she sent were about boyfriend-girlfriend love or husband-wife bonds.

At the same time, Zwan admitted that he just wanted to love someone — even if it led to a breakup — because he wanted to experience giving and sharing love with someone. He softly concluded, “I think that eventually did happen, right?” He also shared a line from a Hindi movie, Sanam Teri kasam that stayed with him: “Don’t hesitate to say sorry, thank you, and I love you — because we may not get another chance to say these three.”",5/13/2024,Talks About Love,"Love, Relationship, Reels",

He told her that now that she was home — and wouldn’t be as active on Instagram — he’d stay off the app too, at least for a few days. He even said, “If anything, just WhatsApp me.” But as with most things between them — plans changed. Contrary to what Zwan expected, Vita was still available most of the time, though her messages weren’t as frequent as when she was in Chennai. Still, her presence was comforting. One day, Vita sent Zwan a video of her holding a snake, and he almost had a heart attack thinking it was real. She casually mentioned that she was thinking of keeping a snake as a pet — and not just a snake — sometimes even talked about keeping wild animals like elephants. Zwan couldn’t help but scream internally, “AIYYYOOOO!” Fortunately, it turned out to be just a snake toy. As the days passed, they slowly resumed sharing romantic reels. Zwan joked that her Instagram feed must be a factory of love reels, because all he ever got in suggestions now were romantic videos — thanks to her. Zwan found himself sighting her for everything — her voice, her laugh, her smile, and even her messages.

"On May 29 2024, there was a special function at Vita’s home. That day, she wore the T-shirt they had bought together at Phoenix Mall, a piece of memory woven into her day. She sent a picture of herself wearing it to Zwan. For the first time ever, Zwan tried to draw her from that photo. It wasn’t perfect. But it was real. And on this day, she send then pic of she eating the KitKat I had given her while traveling home on May 17 2024. Meanwhile, Vita had taken her sister to Coimbatore, where she finished up all the college admission formalities. It was a busy time for her at home, but somehow they kept each other looped into their lives. Zwan had his own plans too — he was heading home for his nephew's birthday which was on June 6 2024, and intended to return on June 9 2024. Since Vita had already spent nearly three weeks at home, she initially planned to return to Chennai on the same day with him, and he quietly hoped they’d travel together. But plans shifted. Vita received an invitation to her friend’s wedding on June 12 2024, and so she told Zwan she might not return on June 9 2024 after all due to friend's marriage. Zwan being cool, replied that it was fine and he understood. But inside, he felt a little sad — because he’d been looking forward to traveling with her, sharing those quiet hours and loud laughs in a bus seat beside each other. Even if he didn't say it out loud — he was going to miss her.",5/29/2024,Vita's Time at home,"Instagram, kitKat, Vita's sister's College Admission, Zwan's Nephew's Birthday",
"On June 5 2024, Zwan boarded a bus to travel home for his nephew’s birthday celebration the next day. While he was on the way, Vita messaged him that she was planning to return back to Chennai on June 9 with Zwan. He playfully asked her, “What about your friend’s marriage?” To that, Vita casually replied that her parents would attend the wedding, and so she’d come back to Chennai with Zwan instead. Zwan didn’t say much in the moment. But deep down, he felt a rush of butterflies in his stomach — that electric blend of excitement, surprise, and emotion.",6/5/2024,White Angel ,"Travel, Fantasy, Love, Excitement",
"Continuing June 5 2024 - But that wasn’t all. Because what followed next was something that changed everything. It was the beginning of the story of the White Angel — a playful, whimsical, yet deeply emotional conversation between Zwan and Vita. A story that wasn’t just a fun chat. It was a spark. Something that would turn many things in the weeks that followed.",,,,
"Continuing June 5 2024 - After Vita confirmed her June 9 return with Zwan, the conversation between them took a playful turn — one that spiraled into an emotionally charged yet humorous fantasy. Zwan teased her by saying that even if she was with him on the bus, he might still “sight other girls.” Vita, in mock rage, warned that if he dared, she would kill him. Laughing, Zwan replied, “Then in heaven, I’ll talk to girls and have fun unlimitedly!.” Vita shot back, “I won’t kill both of us at once. I’ll kill each of us separately.” o that, Zwan chuckled and said, “Fine — if I’m going, you come with me. I don’t want to go to heaven alone. Let’s travel together.”",,,,
"Continuing June 5 2024 - This kicked off the start of the “White Angel” fantasy — Vita imagining herself in heaven wearing white dresses, and Zwan still pretending to be a flirt, only for Vita to say, “I won’t allow it!” To which Zwan replied warmly, “NEER IRUKKURAPPO NAAN VERA YAARA PAAKA POREN.”(“When you’re here, why would I look at anyone else?”) They playfully planned their first mock fight for Sunday during the travel. Outside, it was raining, and both of them quietly wished they were already travelling together. The White Angel story continued for over two hours. They chatted until 1 A.M., with Zwan unable to sleep on the bus. Vita, knowing that, said sweetly, “NAA TEXT PANRATHE THAALAATU… voice note vera anuppi thaalaatu pannanuma?” (“Is my texting soothing enough, or should I send a voice note to help you sleep?”)  She also said there would be no other angels in heaven — just her, the White Angel.",,,,
"Continuing June 5 2024 - Zwan then asked, “If possible, can I go for a long walk with this White Angel?” Vita agreed, and they imagined it vividly. They even said, “INTHA TALK ENGEYO VERA MAARI PORA MAARI THONUTHU” (“This conversation feels like it’s going somewhere deep...”) before finally falling asleep around 1:30 A.M. Zwan would later reflect: ""She really wanted me to spend time and flirt only with her — the White Angel. At this point, when I rethink, we really had that spark and feeling in this conversation…But we just couldn’t openly speak about it.""",,,,
"On June 6, after reaching home Zwan booked ticket for both of them for June 09 2024and only then he left for his nephew's birthdayfunction.",6/6/2024,,,
"On the previous day of our travel, June 8 2024 Vita was having a newly bought SAREE haul and she had sent a beautiful video for her in that Saree.",6/8/2024,,,
"On June 9 2024, Vita was running late to the Gudalur bus stand. Thank God, Zwan had already informed his father that she would be coming with him. The moment she arrived, without any hesitation, she walked straight to Zwan’s father and said warmly, “Hi uncle, how are you?!” Zwan smiled silently at the ease with which she blended into his world. At exactly 2:00 PM, the bus took off. As they settled in, for the first time, Vita casually mentioned a friend named Sudhee, someone she had quickly met before boarding. She said she had gone to talk to him.",6/9/2024,,,
"Continuing June 9 2024 - She had downloaded the movie ‘My Fault’, which they began watching together from Ooty. Unexpectedly, a few bold scenes came up, and they had to close their screens to avoid being noticed by the people sitting nearby—AIYYOOO. While attempting to block the screen, their hands met to cover it, but what started as a casual gesture turned into something deeper—the handholding lasted longer than expected. Though Zwan had held Vita’s hand once before while crossing a road in Chennai, this time it felt different, like he didn’t want to let go.",,,,
"Continuing June 9 2024 - While watching the movie, the bus broke down in the middle of Mettupalayam. They paused the movie and began observing what was happening outside. Once they reached Mettupalayam, the bus made an unusual stop at a hotel. Everyone else started eating, but Zwan and Vita assumed the bus would stop later at Avinashi, where it usually halted for dinner. Instead, they walked about 100 meters away from the veg-only hotel and bought egg rice and chilly chicken from another shop. After dinner, the bus stopped at a workshop for repairs, and while they were waiting outside, a few local boys appeared and started talking to Vita. She casually said they were her juniors, and Zwan couldn't help but think, “Bayangaramaana Alaa Iva.”",,,,
"Continuing June 9 2024 - Once the bus started from the workshop, they resumed watching the movie until they neared Avinashi, their usual dinner spot. They completed the movie, but the bus didn’t stop at the location as expected. Thankfully, they had already bought rice and chicken earlier. Since it was around 10:30 p.m. and most passengers were asleep, they decided to open their dinner and start eating inside the bus. Zwan, seated by the window and holding the food, struggled to eat on his own. At that moment, Vita gently took over and began feeding him the entire dinner with her own hands. It was the first time since childhood that someone had fed Zwan an entire meal—friends may have done it once or twice, but not like this. This small yet profound act reflected the kind of caring, intimate bond they both longed for in a relationship.",,,,
"Continuing June 9 2024 - After finishing their dinner, they planned to sleep. But even as they drifted into rest, they never let go of each other’s hands. With their headsets in place, Vita rested her head on Zwan’s chest, while his other arm gently wrapped around her. It was exactly like what Zwan had once described — a perfect journey, shared with someone you feel deeply connected to. A simple bus ride had become a memory of warmth, closeness, and quiet love.",,,,
"Continuing June 9 2024 - In that quiet, tender moment—lying side by side on the bus, holding hands, sharing one pair of earphones, her head resting on Zwan’s chest and his arm wrapped around her—they both silently realized that they truly had feelings for each other. It was a warmth they couldn’t deny, but one they both knew wouldn’t turn into something more. From feeding each other dinner to falling asleep with their hands still entwined, they lived the kind of closeness that felt like love, even if it couldn’t last. That night became the point of realization: they couldn’t be together, but they could still create memories worth remembering—deep, soft, and unforgettable.",,,,
"On the morning of June 10 2024, they reached the Chennai bus stand. As they were about to part ways, the hug Vita gave Zwan carried a weight of unspoken emotions and layered meanings. This is first time they hug, Vita hugging Zwan. She took a bus to Guindy, while Zwan booked an Uber to head straight to office. Later that morning, she messaged him to say she had reached her room by 11 a.m. The night before, she had surprised him with a KitKat for the very first time",6/10/2024,First hug,Hug,
"On same day June 10 2024, that evening marked another first for them—their very first video call, and it lasted for over an hour, a new chapter opening softly after the journey they had just shared.",,First Video call,Video Call,
"June 11 2024 was the day Vita began sending Zwan her daily vlogs—thoughtful, personal reflections that slowly became a cherished part of his routine. Zwan and Vita found themselve falling for each other—again and again in future episodes, as if each vlog was a quiet thread weaving them closer, even in silence.",6/11/2024,First Vlog Ever,Vlog,
"June 12 2024, Sometimes, Zwan had also started sending Vita his tired yet cheerful vlogs while heading out to play football, sharing bits of his day just as she did. In return, Vita once screenshotted and sent him her Instagram feed — completely filled with saree wear collections.",6/12/2024,,,
"June 13 2024 Vita had sent Zwan countless Taylor Swift reels, each one wrapped in lyrics and emotion, nudging him gently into her world of music. She often asked him to listen to her favorite Taylor Swift songs—not just to share her taste, but with a playful dream in mind: that someday, they could go together to a Taylor Swift concert.",6/13/2024,,,
"June 15 2024 Zwan had to return home the following weekend for Bakrid, and coincidentally, one of his Office colleagues—a girl from Gudalur—had asked if he could travel with her. Before agreeing, he checked with Vita, expecting their first real fight to break out. But to his surprise, she responded with a soft, slightly teasing line: “KNJM kashtam, but unga friend thane, so poyittu vasngall!!”(“A little tough, but she's your friend, so go and come back safely!”). Though she initially acted fine with the idea, her feelings shifted once Zwan was actually on the journey. She began feeling bad, called him midway, and even sent pictures of her irritated expressions. What she said in words didn’t match the ache in her heart—and Zwan could feel it. The weight of that hit him too. When the girl beside him dozed off and accidentally leaned on his shoulder, it unexpectedly reminded him of Vita, and he couldn’t sleep the entire journey. He managed only three hours of rest and later told Vita—not just to irritate her playfully, but also to express something he had come to realize: how deeply she liked him… and how much he was starting to care too.",6/15/2024,Zwan's Bakrid Journey,,
"On June 16 2024, Vita attended a reception with her friend Gayu, and from there, she sent Zwan two videos—one of which stood out vividly. It was her, dressed beautifully. It was the White Angel, the very image they had once playfully imagined and talked about during their late-night chats. She even sent him a few pictures on WhatsApp—the same ones that brought their ""White Angel"" story to life. ",6/16/2024,,Whatsapp,
"On June 17 2024, the day of Bakrid, Zwan did something unusual—he created a vlog and sent all the photos and a video while en route to Ayyankolli, where he was visiting his grandparents. That same day, Vita had planned to order a watch for her sister, who was about to start college, and she had sent Zwan a list of options. Playfully, Zwan teased her saying, “Your sister's voice is more cute than yours.” He wasn’t sure if that was actually true—but he knew deep down, the only voice he preferred listening to now was Vita’s—the voice of his White Angel.",6/17/2024,Bakrid,,
"On June 18 2024, Zwan traveled to Coimbatore to visit a friend and boarded a bus to Chennai later that evening from Coimbatore. During the journey, he and Vita had a video call. Later, when Zwan sat down to have his fried rice and chicken, Vita sent him a food vlog of her own—another simple but warm exchange that made their everyday routines feel a little more connected, a little more shared, no matter the miles between them.",6/18/2024,First Food Vlog,,
"Vita was leaving home that day to spend some time with her sister before she left for college the following month. As she packed her bags, she sent Zwan vlogs of the process, sharing those little pieces of her day. When she reached the bus stand, she called him, and he went to spend a few moments with her before departure. Earlier, Zwan had mentioned that his favorite chocolate used to be Milkybar, though he hadn’t eaten it in a long time. Remembering that, Vita surprised him with a Milkybar, a sweet and nostalgic gesture that instantly brought back old memories. In that small act, she made the moment feel truly special—because she was special too. While travelling her playlist was Taylor Swift's songs, especially Love Story",6/21/2024,MilkyBar,MilkyBar,
"On June 23 2024 After Vita reached home, there was heavy rain in our district. Paavam, her pet dog Paashaa, was clearly not having a great time with the weather. Despite that, Vita kept playfully disturbing Paashaa just to record and send a vlog of the day to Zwan. Though he had never been particularly fond of pet dogs before, her vlogs slowly started to change his mind—the way she interacted with Paashaa, the warmth in those moments. Without realizing it, Zwan too began to grow fond of that little pet, just as he had grown fond of the girl behind the camera.",6/23/2024,Paasha The Pet,,
"June 24 2024 to June 27 2024,Vita took Zwan on a quiet journey through her childhood by sharing her baby pictures and snapshots from her college life, giving him a glimpse into the moments that shaped her. In return, Zwan shared his own baby photos, opening up his past in the same way. Among those memories, she also sent pictures with her cousin Ra, and Zwan, smiling at the coincidence, sent back a photo he had taken with Ra too—since Ra was his friend as well.",6/25/2024,,,
"On June 29 2024 to June 30 2024, Vita and her family traveled to Coimbatore for her sister’s college joining. Even during the trip, she didn’t forget to send Zwan vlogs while visiting the temple, dressed in traditional attire. The fun fact that stuck with Zwan was that, in the month of June alone, Vita had shared over 50 vlogs and pictures to him. ",6/29/2024,,,

"On July 9 2024, Vita asked Zwan a simple but exciting question: “Do you wish to go for a trip?” His answer, without hesitation, was a clear yes. But as the conversation unfolded, he realized she was planning a foreign trip with her ex-colleagues, which made things a bit complicated for him. He gently expressed his concern—how would he explain who he was traveling with on a foreign trip? So he told her honestly that if it was an Indian trip, he’d be totally fine, but for a foreign one, he wasn't so sure. Despite the uncertainty, Zwan was genuinely happy and excited that she even considered traveling with him. It meant something. As a backup plan, they even made a sweet little promise: if no other trip worked out, they’d go on a solo trip to Pondicherry together—just the two of them, no complications, only memories waiting to be made.",7/9/2024,The Solo Trip,,
"On July 11 2024, Zwan began his journey to Tiruppur to attend his friend’s wedding. After the celebration, he returned home Mayfield,Gudalur that same night. Earlier, Vita had planned to travel back to Chennai on Sunday, July 14, and they had both looked forward to traveling together again. But plans shifted—she was suddenly assigned on-call duty for that day and asked Zwan to return ahead without her. Yet, remembering how she had once adjusted her plans to travel with him last time, Zwan decided to do the same. Instead of leaving her behind, he applied for leave on Monday, July 15, just so they could still travel together",7/11/2024,,,
"On July 12 2024 Vita booked the tickets to Chennai for both of them—but separately, haha. Zwan smiled at the little workaround, because if Vava (his dad) could come to drop him off, he might overhear the conductor mentioning their joint ticket. This time, they chose not to let their families know they were traveling together. The both was likely not one that would lead to an ending together as Vita is Hindu while Zwan is Muslim. They didn’t want their families to feel uncomfortable or misread what they themselves hadn’t fully defined.",7/12/2024,,,
"On July 13 2024 - One thing Zwan clearly understood from Vita’s vlogs was that after her sister left for college, she began to feel a bit lonely at home. These days, her vlogs mostly featured just her playing with their pet, Paashaa. Through each playful clip, Zwan could sense the subtle shift in her mood.",7/13/2024,,,
