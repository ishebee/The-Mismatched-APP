"After planning for nearly two to three months, Zwan and Vita were finally set to meet in Chennai on May 11 2024. That morning, Vita had overslept. Zwan had called her a few times, but she didn’t attend the calls. Eventually, between 10 and 11 AM, she woke up, got ready, and reached the mall by 1:30 PM — just in time before the movie began. They had already booked the tickets earlier that morning. The real twist was that Vita had work tchnical support duties that day. She came with her laptop bag, and during the movie, she occasionally checked her work emails on her phone since they had deposited the bag outside the cinema hall. The movie — TAROT — wasn’t particularly scary or entertaining, but for Zwan, watching it with Vita was what made it special. It was fun in its own unique way, and the memory stuck with him. They clicked a few good photos together during the outing. But, as always, Vita preferred photos taken in the mirror over regular selfies — those were her favorite kind. After the movie on May 11 2024, Zwan and Vita planned to go bowling. But the bowling alley was packed with people, so they decided to grab some snacks around 4 PM. Then came the one thing Zwan had secretly hoped to avoid: shopping. Vita spotted Trends and Pantaloons, and her eyes lit up with the idea of doing just a ""small"" round of shopping. Though Zwan hesitated at first, he eventually agreed to go along with her. While shopping, Vita was on a mission — she was looking for crop tops, but instead of adult sections, she dove straight into the kids' section to check out every single T-shirt there. She kept clicking photos of the outfits she tried in trial room and send to Zwan to check it was good for her. Zwan later always remembered, with a smile, that those photos she took were just like “these ones” — charming, spontaneous, and very much her. After their quirky shopping spree, they went for dinner at a restaurant opposite Samco. Vita absolutely loved the food — especially the masala prawn fry. She would often tell Zwan afterward that it was one of her favorites. Once dinner was done, Zwan dropped Vita off at Guindy, from where she boarded a Rapido. He took the local train and headed home. That night, after reaching their places, they had a long call that lasted for almost an hour — reliving the day and talking about every tiny detail that made it memorable.

"On tMay 13 2024, Zwan and Vita had one of their deepest conversations yet — about love, relationships, and marriage. It all started when Zwan mentioned a book he had recently read for the first time: ""It Ends With Us"" by Colleen Hoover. From there, the discussion shifted naturally into their personal thoughts on relationships and how they envisioned their own. Vita shared that she truly wanted to love someone wholeheartedly, even though her past relationship hadn’t been a pleasant one. She and Zwan often exchanged Instagram reels, and many of the reels she sent were about boyfriend-girlfriend love or husband-wife bonds. She once told him, “After watching all these reels, I wish my husband or boyfriend would be like some of those people in them in which boyfriend remembers dates and surprises with that.” Zwan couldn’t help but laugh at how his entire Instagram algorithm had transformed into a romantic reel engine, all thanks to her. They didn’t shy away from more serious aspects either. Zwan brought up male ego as a common issue in relationships, to which Vita insightfully responded, “It’s not just male ego — both people shouldn’t carry ego into a relationship.” Vita spoke vulnerably about her longing to be loved, to express love, and to have someone to pour that love into. At the same time, Zwan admitted that he just wanted to love someone — even if it led to a breakup — because he wanted to experience giving and sharing love with someone. He softly concluded, “I think that eventually did happen, right?” He also shared a line from a Hindi movie, Sanam Teri kasam that stayed with him: “Don’t hesitate to say sorry, thank you, and I love you — because we may not get another chance to say these three.”",5/13/2024,Talks About Love,It Ends with Us,

For the first time ever, Zwan decided to go to the bus stand to see her off, just to spend a little time with her before she left and send of her. His teammates had already started teasing him when he mentioned his plan to go all the way to the bus stop. But he didn’t mind — it was worth it. When Vita boarded the bus, she found that one of her school classmates was also traveling on the same bus. They began chatting and catching up immediately. Later, Zwan messaged her and joked, “It would've been even more fun if I had been on that bus with you. I could have flirted with that friend.” As usual Zwan had Kitkat for her.",5/17/2024,First Time Zwan Sending off Vita,Spending Time Together,
"Between May 18 2024 and May 28 2024, After Vita reached home, Zwan openly confessed to her that he had been using Instagram more often just because of her. He told her that now that she was home — and wouldn’t be as active on Instagram — he’d stay off the app too, at least for a few days. He even said, “If anything, just WhatsApp me.” But as with most things between them — plans changed. Contrary to what Zwan expected, Vita was still available most of the time, though her messages weren’t as frequent as when she was in Chennai. Still, her presence was comforting. One day, Vita sent Zwan a video of her holding a snake, and he almost had a heart attack thinking it was real. She casually mentioned that she was thinking of keeping a snake as a pet — and not just a snake — sometimes even talked about keeping wild animals like elephants. Zwan couldn’t help but scream internally, “AIYYYOOOO!” Fortunately, it turned out to be just a snake toy. As the days passed, they slowly resumed sharing romantic reels. Zwan joked that her Instagram feed must be a factory of love reels, because all he ever got in suggestions now were romantic videos — thanks to her. Zwan found himself sighting her for everything — her voice, her laugh, her smile, and even her messages. At one point, Zwan shared a reel featuring a “Love Guru”, and Vita responded by sharing the actual channel with him.

And on this day, she send then pic of she eating the KitKat I had given her while traveling home on May 17 2024.

It was a busy time for her at home, but somehow they kept each other looped into their lives. Zwan had his own plans too — he was heading home for his nephew's birthday which was on June 6 2024, and intended to return on June 9 2024. Since Vita had already spent nearly three weeks at home, she initially planned to return to Chennai on the same day with him, and he quietly hoped they’d travel together. But plans shifted. Vita received an invitation to her friend’s wedding on June 12 2024, and so she told Zwan she might not return on June 9 2024 after all due to friend's marriage. Zwan being cool, replied that it was fine and he understood. But inside, he felt a little sad — because he’d been looking forward to traveling with her, sharing those quiet hours and loud laughs in a bus seat beside each other. Even if he didn't say it out loud — he was going to miss her.",5/29/2024,Vita's Time at home,Vita's sister's College Admission,
"On June 5 2024, Zwan boarded a bus to travel home for his nephew’s birthday celebration the next day. While he was on the way, Vita messaged him that she was planning to return back to Chennai on June 9 with Zwan. He playfully asked her, “What about your friend’s marriage?” To that, Vita casually replied that her parents would attend the wedding, and so she’d come back to Chennai with Zwan instead. Zwan didn’t say much in the moment. But deep down, he felt a rush of butterflies in his stomach — that electric blend of excitement, surprise, and emotion. Continuing June 5 2024 - But that wasn’t all. Because what followed next was something that changed everything. It was the beginning of the story of the White Angel — a playful, whimsical, yet deeply emotional conversation between Zwan and Vita. A story that wasn’t just a fun chat. It was a spark. Something that would turn many things in the weeks that followed. Continuing June 5 2024 - After Vita confirmed her June 9 return with Zwan, the conversation between them took a playful turn — one that spiraled into an emotionally charged yet humorous fantasy. Zwan teased her by saying that even if she was with him on the bus, he might still “sight other girls.” Vita, in mock rage, warned that if he dared, she would kill him. Laughing, Zwan replied, “Then in heaven, I’ll talk to girls and have fun unlimitedly!.” Vita shot back, “I won’t kill both of us at once. I’ll kill each of us separately.” o that, Zwan chuckled and said, “Fine — if I’m going, you come with me. I don’t want to go to heaven alone. Let’s travel together.” Continuing June 5 2024 - This kicked off the start of the “White Angel” fantasy — Vita imagining herself in heaven wearing white dresses, and Zwan still pretending to be a flirt, only for Vita to say, “I won’t allow it!” To which Zwan replied warmly, “NEER IRUKKURAPPO NAAN VERA YAARA PAAKA POREN.”(“When you’re here, why would I look at anyone else?”) They playfully planned their first mock fight for Sunday during the travel. Outside, it was raining, and both of them quietly wished they were already travelling together. The White Angel story continued for over two hours. They chatted until 1 A.M., with Zwan unable to sleep on the bus. Vita, knowing that, said sweetly, “NAA TEXT PANRATHE THAALAATU… voice note vera anuppi thaalaatu pannanuma?” (“Is my texting soothing enough, or should I send a voice note to help you sleep?”) She also said there would be no other angels in heaven — just her, the White Angel. Continuing June 5 2024 - Zwan then asked, “If possible, can I go for a long walk with this White Angel?” Vita agreed, and they imagined it vividly. They even said, “INTHA TALK ENGEYO VERA MAARI PORA MAARI THONUTHU” (“This conversation feels like it’s going somewhere deep...”) before finally falling asleep around 1:30 A.M. Zwan would later reflect: ""She really wanted me to spend time and flirt only with her — the White Angel. At this point, when I rethink, we really had that spark and feeling in this conversation…But we just couldn’t openly speak about it.""",6/5/2024,White Angel ,Fantasy,

"On June 9 2024, Vita was running late to the Gudalur bus stand. Thank God, Zwan had already informed his father that she would be coming with him. The moment she arrived, without any hesitation, she walked straight to Zwan’s father and said warmly, “Hi uncle, how are you?!” Zwan smiled silently at the ease with which she blended into his world. At exactly 2:00 PM, the bus took off. Their travel started from Gudalur to Chennai. As they settled in, for the first time, Vita casually mentioned a friend named Sudhee, someone she had quickly met before boarding. She said she had gone to talk to him. Vita had downloaded the movie ‘My Fault’, which they began watching together from Ooty during the travel. Unexpectedly, a few bold scenes came up, and they had to close their screens to avoid being noticed by the people sitting nearby—AIYYOOO. While attempting to block the screen, their hands met to cover it, but what started as a casual gesture turned into something deeper—the handholding lasted longer than expected. Though Zwan had held Vita’s hand once before while crossing a road in Chennai, this time it felt different, like he didn’t want to let go. On Same June 9 2024 - While watching the movie in their travel to Chennai, the bus broke down in the middle of Mettupalayam. They paused the movie and began observing what was happening outside. Once they reached Mettupalayam, the bus made an unusual stop at a hotel. Everyone else started eating, but Zwan and Vita assumed the bus would stop later at Avinashi, where it usually halted for dinner. Instead, they walked about 100 meters away from the veg-only hotel and bought egg rice and chilly chicken from another shop. After dinner, the bus stopped at a workshop for repairs, and while they were waiting outside, a few local boys appeared and started talking to Vita. She casually said they were her juniors, and Zwan couldn't help but think, “Bayangaramaana Alaa Iva.” On June 9 2024 - Once the bus started from the workshop and resumed their travel, they resumed watching the movie until they neared Avinashi, their usual dinner spot. They completed the movie, but the bus didn’t stop at the location as expected. Thankfully, they had already bought rice and chicken earlier. Since it was around 10:30 p.m. and most passengers were asleep, they decided to open their dinner and start eating inside the bus. Zwan, seated by the window and holding the food, struggled to eat on his own. At that moment, Vita gently took over and began feeding him the entire dinner with her own hands. It was the first time since childhood that someone had fed Zwan an entire meal—friends may have done it once or twice, but not like this. This small yet profound act reflected the kind of caring, intimate bond they both longed for in a relationship.After finishing their dinner, they planned to sleep. But even as they drifted into rest, they never let go of each other’s hands. With their headsets in place, Vita rested her head on Zwan’s chest, while his other arm gently wrapped around her. It was exactly like what Zwan had once described — a perfect journey, shared with someone you feel deeply connected to. A simple bus ride had become a memory of warmth, closeness, and quiet love. In that quiet, tender moment—lying side by side on the bus, holding hands, sharing one pair of earphones, her head resting on Zwan’s chest and his arm wrapped around her—they both silently realized that they truly had feelings for each other. It was a warmth they couldn’t deny, but one they both knew wouldn’t turn into something more. From feeding each other dinner to falling asleep with their hands still entwined, they lived the kind of closeness that felt like love, even if it couldn’t last. That night became the point of realization: they couldn’t be together, but they could still create memories worth remembering—deep, soft, and unforgettable.",6/9/2024,My Fault,Vita Feeding Zwan,
"On the morning of June 10 2024, they reached the Chennai bus stand. As they were about to part ways, the hug Vita gave Zwan carried a weight of unspoken emotions and layered meanings. This is first time they hug, Vita hugging Zwan. She took a bus to Guindy, while Zwan booked an Uber to head straight to office. Later that morning, she messaged him to say she had reached her room by 11 a.m. The night before, she had surprised him with a KitKat for the very first time. On same day June 10 2024, that evening marked another first for them—their very first video call, and it lasted for over an hour, a new chapter opening softly after the journey they had just shared.",6/10/2024,First hug and first video call,Hug and video call,

"June 15 2024 Zwan had to return home the following weekend for Bakrid, and coincidentally, one of his Office colleagues—a girl from Gudalur—had asked if he could travel with her. Before agreeing, he checked with Vita, expecting their first real fight to break out. But to his surprise, she responded with a soft, slightly teasing line: “KNJM kashtam, but unga friend thane, so poyittu vasngall!!”(“A little tough, but she's your friend, so go and come back safely!”). Though she initially acted fine with the idea, her feelings shifted once Zwan was actually on the journey. She began feeling bad, called him midway, and even sent pictures of her irritated expressions. What she said in words didn’t match the ache in her heart—and Zwan could feel it. The weight of that hit him too. When the girl beside him dozed off and accidentally leaned on his shoulder, it unexpectedly reminded him of Vita, and he couldn’t sleep the entire journey. He managed only three hours of rest and later told Vita—not just to irritate her playfully, but also to express something he had come to realize: how deeply she liked him… and how much he was starting to care too.",6/15/2024,Zwan's Bakrid Journey,Zwan's Travel with another girl,

As she packed her bags, she sent Zwan vlogs of the process, sharing those little pieces of her day. When she reached the bus stand, she called him, and he went to spend a few moments with her before departure. Earlier, Zwan had mentioned that his favorite chocolate used to be Milkybar, though he hadn’t eaten it in a long time. Remembering that, Vita surprised him with a Milkybar, a sweet and nostalgic gesture that instantly brought back old memories.

Though he had never been particularly fond of pet dogs before, her vlogs slowly started to change his mind—the way she interacted with Paashaa, the warmth in those moments.

"On July 9 2024, Vita asked Zwan a simple but exciting question: “Do you wish to go for a trip?” His answer, without hesitation, was a clear yes. But as the conversation unfolded, he realized she was planning a foreign trip with her ex-colleagues, which made things a bit complicated for him. He gently expressed his concern—how would he explain who he was traveling with on a foreign trip? So he told her honestly that if it was an Indian trip, he’d be totally fine, but for a foreign one, he wasn't so sure. Despite the uncertainty, Zwan was genuinely happy and excited that she even considered traveling with him. It meant something. As a backup plan, they even made a sweet little promise: if no other trip worked out, they’d go on a solo trip to Pondicherry together—just the two of them, no complications, only memories waiting to be made.",7/9/2024,The Solo Trip,Trip Together,

But plans shifted—she was suddenly assigned on-call duty for that day and asked Zwan to return ahead without her.

"On July 15 2024, Monday, it was pouring heavily when Zwan left for the Gudalur bus stand. Because of the rain, Vava didn’t come with him, so Zwan took an auto and reached the stop on his own. Vita arrived a bit later but made it just before the bus departed. She was visibly upset—drenched from the rain after rushing from her place. In the hurry, she hadn’t eaten properly, and since the bus started right after she arrived, she didn’t get time to buy snacks either—her snacks bag was completely empty. Their travel from Gudalur to Chennai started at 2:00 on that day. They both decided to wait until the bus reached Ooty to grab something. This time, Vita had already planned the entertainment—a romantic college series called Maxton Hall, which she had downloaded in advance. They started watching it once they left Ooty, and the first episode really hooked them both. They had hoped to binge-watch the whole series during the journey, but partway through the second episode, Zwan began to feel nauseous, so they paused it. Unlike the last trip, the bus this time was smooth and comfortable—no breakdowns, no chaos, just them. And even while watching the series, at some points, they had to close the screen discreetly, though it wasn’t as awkward as when they watched My Fault. Just like before, their hands found each other again, locked in a quiet, warm grip that spoke more than words. That night, since the bus had no issues after a long wait, Zwan and Vita were finally able to have their dinner at their favorite mess in Avinashi—chicken rice, kalki, and omelette. After their meal, they grabbed some cool drinks and boarded the bus again. What followed was a moment suspended between reality and quiet understanding.They began to talk, softly, about how they knew they couldn’t be together, at least not in the way life usually expects. Yet, even while acknowledging that, they chose to enjoy what they had in the present. As the bus rolled ahead into the night, Vita leaned on Zwan’s shoulder, their fingers intertwined, his arm around her. There was a stillness in the air, the kind that only comes before something deeply emotional unfolds. Then, without planning or even fully realizing how, they crossed the threshold between friendship and something more. It wasn’t dramatic—it was quiet, tender. In a moment of closeness, comfort, and unsaid words. They kissed, 2 kisses. Vita Kissed Zwan on July 15 2024 midnight and second kiss on July 16 2024 early morning.Arms locked, hearts unguarded, they simply lived the moment, knowing well it might never repeat—but also knowing they’d never forget it. Though Zwan and Vita had just shared one of their most beautiful and intimate moments together, he couldn’t help but tease her the very next day. A girl had taken the seat next to them, and Zwan jokingly pretended to flirt with the girl, just to irritate Vita—who, unsurprisingly, tried to stop him with that familiar mix of frustration and amusement.",7/15/2024,July Travel,Expressed by Actions,
"By early morning July 16 2024, around 6 to 6:30, they reached Chennai bus stand. As always, Vita took her handbag and went to the washroom, her usual stop for freshening up and doing a quick makeup touch-up. Zwan reflected on how he used to tease people for wearing makeup, but being with Vita had completely changed his perspective. He now saw beauty in those little rituals—how she did it not for vanity, but for confidence, for joy, for herself. Before parting ways, they shared a hug that carried more than just warmth—it held emotions, memories, and a quiet sadness that came with knowing this moment was now in the past and they really doesn't have a future together. The hug was a secure hug fir her. She felt safe in that hug. With a few tears hidden behind smiles, they walked in opposite directions, hearts full, already thinking about their next meeting in Chennai.",7/16/2024,Third hug,Expressed by Actions,
"After reaching her room on July 16, 2024, following their heartfelt journey, Vita began watching Maxton Hall—the series they had started together on the bus.

So moved, she even shared her Amazon Prime credentials with Zwan, insisting he must watch it from start to finish and share his thoughts with her. It wasn’t just a show—it had become an emotional mirror for both of them.",7/16/2024,Maxton Hall,Emotion,
"On July 17, 2024, something subtly meaningful unfolded. Vita, who usually posted her photos on Instagram without much tagging, tagged Zwan in one of her stories—not just in the photo, but specifically for the music and lyrics she chose for it. Zwan admitted he was initially scared to repost the story, worried it might be too public or revealing. But Vita casually reassured him: “You can repost, or do anything with it—it’s not a problem.” In that moment, Zwan realized that Vita truly liked him deeply. She had begun associating many of her favorite English song lyrics with their shared moments. Zwan couldn’t help but wonder—had she grown too emotionally attached? Would this one-sided reality hurt her eventually? Yet, writing this in retrospect, he felt relieved knowing she seemed to be doing okay now. That day, Vita was also cleaning her wardrobe, and she vlogged it all to Zwan, saying it was too difficult—especially her makeup section, which was a mess after being untouched for weeks since she’d left home. Zwan, more than watching the vlog, found himself falling even harder for her voice, expressions, and the way she shared her little world with him. Her vlogs didn’t just show her day—they made Zwan feel special in a way no one had before.",7/17/2024,Story Tag,Song Lyrics,
"From July 17, 2024, daily video calls became a routine between Zwan and Vita. Even though Zwan had warned her gently about the risks of growing emotionally attached by talking so frequently, Vita didn’t care at that moment. All she wanted was to talk to him, to be with him in those moments—fully, sincerely, and presently. There were times she would cry, overwhelmed by the thought that they could never truly be together, or that these long video calls and heartfelt conversations might not last forever.",7/17/2024,Video Call Routine,Video Call,

Meanwhile, they had already made plans to meet on Saturday, July 20, at Forum Mall and had booked tickets for the movie Kalki. That evening, Vita was out with her school friends who had come to Chennai for a get-together. She mentioned she'd call after reaching back to her room. Before heading out, though, she made time for a quick video call around 7 PM, but ended up reaching back only around 1:00 AM. Understanding her delay, she sent Zwan a vlog, apologizing for not being able to call and promising to talk the next day. She had clearly enjoyed the evening and was particularly fond of her friend’s pet dog, clicking plenty of pictures and videos with it—Zwan knew how much she adored such moments.One recurring thing Zwan often pointed out to Vita—playfully, but sincerely—was her habit of frequent online shopping and ordering food. Almost every other call would reveal some new courier delivery or Zomato order. Though he did the same occasionally, Vita’s rate outpaced his, and as someone who cared, he always reminded her to try spending a little less. She would even vlog those small moments, unboxing her items or showing him the new deliveries, and in those little digital windows, Zwan found himself cherishing her quirks more and more each day.",7/18/2024,July Chennai meet Plan,Online shopping,
"On July 19, 2024, Vita had surprisingly woken up very early at 5:45 AM, something quite unlike her. When Zwan asked her about it, she said she'd had a disturbing dream involving an elephant from her hometown, which had jolted her awake. Concerned, she immediately called her father to check if everything was alright, and only then did she feel relieved. That same day, Zwan wore a semi-formal shirt and pants to office, which was unusual for him. He took pictures and shared them with Vita. Later, he planned to post those pictures on Instagram, and it was Vita who searched for the perfect background song to match the vibe of the post. Coincidentally, she also shared an old picture of herself that day, where she was wearing a similar outfit—white shirt and formal pants—as if mirroring him unintentionally. These parallel moments between them—early morning calls, synced outfits, shared creativity for posts—reflected how deeply woven they had become into each other's daily lives, often in small but touching ways.",7/19/2024,Posting Photo Together,Instagram,
"On July 20, 2024, the day began with a video call between Zwan and Vita, during which she sent him a cute picture. As Zwan reflects while writing, he realizes their chats from then were filled with reels they had shared, especially related to Taylor Swift’s love story and other romantic moments. After the call, they both got ready to meet. They had planned to meet at Guindy Metro Station and travel together to Forum Mall, Vadapalani as Vita hadn’t used the Metro in a long time. Zwan was ready by 10:30 AM and reached the local railway station. During this time, Vita video called again and stayed on the call while he waited for the train. She was still getting ready—doing her makeup and packing her bag on camera—and Zwan recalls how special she made him feel in such everyday moments. They met as planned and traveled together to the mall, reaching around 1 PM, just in time for lunch. They ordered food from KFC, had chicken and cold drinks. Zwan notes how Vita was on her period that day, and though he suggested postponing the meet, she was adamant about seeing him. The funniest part? Despite being on her periods, she still wanted fast food. She always did what she liked and never held back her words—and that, Zwan realized, was one of the qualities he cherished most about her.",7/20/2024,July Chennai Meet,Kalki Movie,

Among all their pictures, Zwan considers the ones taken that day his absolute favorites—especially because of the warmth and vibe they captured. Their booked movie, Kalki, began at 3:30 PM, and both enjoyed it thoroughly. Post-movie, while continuing to roam around the mall, they stepped into a bookshop. There, Zwan found and gifted Vita the novel It Ends With Us—his most beloved romantic book. He had always wanted her to read it. After exiting the mall, they decided to skip dinner and caught the Metro to Guindy. Zwan recalls that the photo they took inside the Metro became another favorite memory from that day. He then dropped Vita at her PG , Pink Elites in Porur, with a beautiful hug Zwan headed to the local railway station. Even after parting ways, the connection lingered. Vita video called Zwan after finishing her routine family calls, while he reached Tambaram. Later, by 11 PM, once he reached his office, they had another video call before sleeping.

In between, Zwan received a call from his school crush who wanted help with a job application. After the brief interruption, he rejoined Vita on the call. What followed was a marathon video call that lasted more than six hours. They spoke about everything—from childhood memories, school days, to the moment they first met on the bus. It was a heartfelt, deep conversation that flowed effortlessly between two people emotionally close. What made the day even more special was that Vita skipped her lunch just to continue the conversation. Zwan couldn’t help but think—isn’t this the kind of moment anyone would fall for? Someone who chooses connection over comfort. For Zwan, it was one of those rare, ""aww"" moments that define something truly special.",7/21/2024,The Longest Video Call,6 hours video call,
"On July 22, 2024, Zwan and Vita were together again, and during their time, Vita received a call from her ex-colleague John, who was reaching out to help her with income tax filing. He had asked to meet in person, but Vita was uncomfortable with the idea. She shared with Zwan that during a past movie outing, John had crossed a boundary by putting his arm around her without consent, which left her with a negative impression. Instead of meeting John, Vita and Zwan sat together and completed the IT filing themselves and simply informed John once it was done. Later, while listening to Taylor Swift’s “Love Story”, a favorite of Vita’s, she playfully offered the lyrics to Zwan and even sang parts of it, sending him a video. It was one of those adorably endearing acts that Zwan cherished deeply—moments that made him feel how incredibly lucky someone would be to have Vita as a partner. After Vita had mentioned her past discomfort with John, Zwan couldn’t help but ask her a question that had been quietly lingering in his mind. He gently asked whether she had ever felt anything uncomfortable or inappropriate during their moments together — especially considering the closeness they had recently shared. Vita, with her usual honesty and warmth, assured him that she had never felt anything bad in their time together. Her words were sincere and comforting. That moment meant a lot to Zwan. It reaffirmed that what they shared wasn’t just mutual respect, but something deeply genuine and emotionally safe. Once again, Zwan understood — she truly liked him a lot.",7/22/2024,IT Filing,Love Story Lyrics,
"On July 23, 2024, during one of their usual video calls, Vita did something unexpectedly sweet. While talking, she took several screenshots of Zwan’s candid expressions, carefully captured during their conversation. Later, she collaged those images into a short video and added an English song with lyrics, ""You and me Belong together, cold ice tea and warm wheather ..."" that she felt closely reflected their bond. When Vita sent the video to Zwan, he couldn’t stop blushing. The way she had noticed and preserved his little expressions made him feel deeply seen and cherished. Watching that video, Zwan said he even began to fall in love with himself — through her eyes.",7/23/2024,Video Call Screenshots,Belong Together,
"On July 24, 2024, Zwan and Vita had naturally shifted much of their messaging to WhatsApp instead of Instagram, especially since their daily video calls had become a part of their routine. That day, Vita shared something personal—a list of the email IDs she used to store her photos and videos.Two of those email IDs ended with 3120 and 2031, and Zwan immediately caught the significance. “31” was Vita’s birthdate, and “20” belonged to her close school friend’s birthdate. Though she no longer kept in close contact with her school friends, the fact that she had memorialized those dates in her email IDs made Zwan feel something quietly profound. It showed him how deeply she once cherished her connections—and it made him feel even more special to now be part of her present. It was a small discovery, but it left a warm imprint.",7/24/2024,Email 3120 and 2031,Email Story,
"On July 25, 2024, Zwan reinstalled Snapchat after a long time, just to connect with Vita in a more casual, private way. They began using Snapchat for their long video calls, partly because it didn’t log messages or call history, making it feel more spontaneous and unfiltered. For a few days, they even kept a Snapchat streak going, something light and fun between them. But eventually, the streak ended.",7/25/2024,Snapchat,Snapchat Installed,
"By July 26, 2024, Vita had been consistently sharing vlogs and photos of her day-to-day life, the kind of sweet, personal moments that Zwan treasured deeply. He had even created a special folder in his gallery titled “Buddy” just to store all of these. One particularly funny memory stood out. On the day they were filing her IT returns, Vita's phone died due to low battery. But they didn’t let that stop them. Instead, they switched to Google Meet to continue their video call. It was so unexpected and quirky, Zwan couldn’t help but laugh even thinking about it later. That’s what made their bond so unique—finding ways to stay connected, even in the smallest, most improvised moments.",7/26/2024,Folder Buddy,Staying Connected,
"On July 27, 2024, Vita left for Coimbatore to visit her sister Thangamani. The night before, she had asked Zwan to be her alarm for the morning, so he called and woke her up. They even had a video call before she left around 6:00 AM. As expected, she fell asleep on the bus, and later around 10:00 AM, she called Zwan again after he woke up from his second round of sleep. During her travel, Vita began reading the book It Ends With Us, the one Zwan had gifted her. She sent him a vlog from the bus, as always, turning her journey into yet another shared experience. Zwan joked to himself that she had unofficially become his personal daily-life blogger, food blogger, makeup blogger—and now, even a travel blogger. After reaching Coimbatore, she picked up her sister from the hostel and went to their cousins' home, where they spent Sunday together, enjoying time with family. Then, on July 28 2024(Sunday evening), as she boarded the bus back to Chennai, she finally video called Zwan after 24 hours of no calls or messages—a gap that felt long for the both of them. That call, after a day of silence, felt extra special.",7/27/2024,Vita's Coimbatore travel,No calls for a day,
"Around the end of July 2024, Zwan and Vita had a playful and subtle moment of connection—they both posted photos on Instagram at the same time, and it was Vita who chose the music for Zwan’s post. It was a small gesture, but it carried a quiet intimacy that only the two of them understood. During this period, Vita also opened up about some practical struggles she was facing. She mentioned an issue with her ex-hostel manager, who had still not returned her advance payment, which was understandably frustrating. On top of that, she was now dealing with high electricity charges in her current room—despite barely using power-heavy appliances. Zwan listened patiently, offering empathy and support, knowing that even these seemingly ordinary concerns were pieces of her daily life she chose to share with him—and that meant everything.",7/29/2024,Vita's Ex hostel balance,Photos,
"On July 30, 2024, Zwan experienced what he felt was the peak of Vita’s affection toward him. She had created and sent him a video montage made up of their shared frames, beautifully set to the emotional lyrics of the song “Dhanamum Un Nenappu Baby.” At first glance, it might have seemed like just a sweet video. But for Zwan, it meant so much more—it was a pure, heartfelt gesture from someone who genuinely liked him. He told her, half-blushing, half-serious, that his feelings for her only deepened when she did things like this. But amid the sweetness, there was also a tinge of worry in Zwan. He confessed that he was afraid—afraid she might get hurt, that she was becoming too attached to the idea of them. Vita’s response, however, was calm and composed. She told him that she wouldn’t be hurt unless she expected something from him, and at that moment, she wasn’t expecting anything. She reassured him that even if things didn’t work out, she would be okay—she would move on without pain. That day showed Zwan not just how much Vita liked him, but also how deeply self-aware and emotionally mature she was, even when navigating something as complex as an undefined bond.",7/30/2024,Dhanamum Un Nenappu Baby,Peak of Vita's Love,
"In July alone, he had saved over 150 vlogs and photos in her ""Buddy"" folder. “Isn’t that huge?” Zwan thought. It was more than just a number. It was a mirror of how real, how alive those moments had been—even if they now lived only in memories",7/31/2024,Buddy Folder,Folder Growing,
"On August 1, 2024, Vita’s close friend Gayathri (Gayu) joined her PG accommodation, marking the beginning of a new routine for her. During their conversations, Vita opened up to Gayu about Zwan.

She seemed a little down because she knew she wouldn’t be able to video call him later that day, as she and Gayathri (Gayu) had plans to go out shopping for Gayu’s things after the workout. Zwan and Vita had already planned to meet the next day, August 4, at Phoenix Mall, so Zwan took this chance to playfully irritate her by asking to be introduced to Gayu. He had mixed feelings about her. On one hand, he appreciated Gayu—she played a role in helping Vita move on, making the transition emotionally easier in future. On the other hand, he couldn’t help but feel a bit of resentment, because since Gayu’s presence, Vita hadn't been the same with him. Still, he reminded himself: “It’s okay, this was for good.” Vita had already told Gayu everything—how much she liked Zwan, what they shared, and how they couldn’t have a future together. That honesty mattered to him. Even if things couldn’t last, what they had was acknowledged, named, and felt deeply—and that meant something real.",8/3/2024,Gym Matters,Vita joined Gym,
"On August 4, 2024, a Sunday, Zwan and Vita had planned a meet-up at Phoenix Mall. They met at Guindy, booked an Uber, and on the way, Zwan brought up something that had been lingering in his thoughts—this could be their last meet in Chennai. They had also talked about their upcoming trip home for Independence Day, considering it possibly their last journey together before Vita’s birthday, hoping it would help reduce any deepening attachment. They reached the mall just in time for lunch, indulged in snacks and the ice cream Vita had been craving, and went shopping. As always, she went straight to the kids section, looking for crop tops and shorts, joking about wearing them if they ever went to Pondicherry—just for fun. Later, they had dinner at Samco, but unfortunately, her favorite masala prawn fry wasn’t available that day. Before they left, she spotted a small clothing store nearby, and they ended up buying new clothes for her and a track pant for Zwan, planned for a cricket game the following weekend. She captured a little moment from their day—a video—and Snapchatted it to Ra (Arun), while Zwan forwarded the same clip over WhatsApp. After dropping her back at her PG, Zwan returned home, after a hug.",8/4/2024,3rd Chennai Meet,Again Pheonix,

She reached her sister’s home around 2 PM on August 10 and spent a good, peaceful day there before returning to her room by the next night, August 11 2024. On August 11 2024 evening, they had a video call—one that would unknowingly become significant. It was the last video call initiated by Vita.

"Between August 14 and August 19, 2024, Zwan and Vita took a meaningful journey together — they traveled from Chennai to their hometown Gudalur for the Independence Day holidays, and then returned to Chennai together on August 19. It was the first time they had ever gone home and come back together — a moment that should have felt intimate, but strangely, it was different. During her time at home, Vita even had a photoshoot done for her matrimonial profile — a quiet, symbolic moment that hinted at the direction her life was slowly heading toward, separate from the tangled thread of what once was between them. This time, there were no holding hands, no long gazes, no lingering moments — they just talked throughout both journeys. Zwan couldn’t understand how or why it happened this way. He kept wondering if it was Vita’s self-control, or maybe his own suppressed feelings, or perhaps a mutual, silent decision — an unspoken boundary to not drift into something deeper. They only leaned their heads on each other's shoulders when their necks hurt, nothing more. For Zwan, this restraint didn’t feel natural — he knew he wasn’t good at controlling emotions. That’s why he thought maybe it was Vita who held back this time. Maybe she had reached a space of clarity.

Despite that, she still pushed herself to go to the gym, though it was clear she wasn’t in her best condition. It was the time of her periods, and for the next three to five days, she remained a bit off, both physically and emotionally. During this time, Zwan noticed the change in her, and perhaps sensing the need to focus on himself too, he began going to the gym as well. It marked a subtle shift — where both began to tend to their own spaces a little more, yet still connected by concern and unspoken care.",8/23/2024,Vita's period Gym,Zwan to Gym,

That day at the gym, she mentioned to Zwan that she noticed a guy — someone she playfully admitted to ""sighting."" Later, that same guy asked for her number, and after she returned to her room, he even asked her out for a coffee. Surprisingly, Zwan didn’t discourage her. Instead, he encouraged her to go for the coffee date, even if it stirred a strange feeling inside. Vita went on that date—actually a lunch—with the guy, and Zwan remembered his name: John. On same day August 27 2024 is the last day Vita had shared a vlog with Zwan, that too after 10 days. After this Vita hadn't shared a vlog to Zwan.",8/27/2024,Last Vlog Shared,Vlog,
"On Aug 29 2024, Vita had completed reading “It Ends With Us”, and the book had clearly left a deep impact on her. Whenever she stumbled upon a line or a moment that felt relatable to their story, she would snap a photo and send it to Zwan on WhatsApp — little fragments of emotion she wanted to share, just to say “I feel this too.” By this time, the movie adaptation of the book was released in theatres, and Zwan had expressed a quiet wish: “If possible, I wish to watch this movie with you.” A simple line, but packed with meaning — perhaps one last shared moment from a story that echoed theirs. And among all the quotes, their favorite remained: “In the future... if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again... fall in love with me. You're still my favorite person, Lily. Always will be.” It was a reflection of everything they were — close, almost perfect, but not quite meant to be.",8/29/2024,Completed Book,It Ends with Us,

Vita had gone to watch “It Ends With Us” with Gayu, the very movie Zwan had once expressed a heartfelt wish to watch with her. He wasn’t upset at her, not really. He had even told her about his wish casually before. But when it actually happened — when she saw the movie without him — it hit him harder than expected. It was the first time something between them truly stung, not because of any wrongdoing, but because of what it symbolized: that some moments they hoped to share might now belong to others. And Zwan, who usually carried everything with a smile, just felt deeply emotional, quietly holding the weight of what was slipping away.",8/30/2024,Book Movie,Zwan's Sadness,

Zwan couldn’t quite explain what changed after the Independence Day travel, but he felt it deep inside. Their connection, once effortless and vibrant, now felt distant, muffled, paused. He wasn’t angry. In fact, he was genuinely happy that Vita seemed to have moved on, found peace, found balance.

"On September 15, 2024, while Zwan was returning from home, the bus broke down near Mettupalayam hill and moved slowly. For dinner, it stopped right in front of the same hotel that had once strengthened the bond between him and Vita back in June. This memory struck him deeply, and so after dinner, he tried calling her. He called more than three times, but there was no answer. This made him panic — he didn’t know what had happened. Two thoughts ran through his mind: one, maybe she was not feeling well; two, maybe she was deliberately avoiding him. Zwan felt he could accept if she was avoiding him, but he needed her to be open about it. What really made him panic was the fear that she might not be okay. He started trembling in his seat and, feeling overwhelmed, called a close friend who knew about his feelings for Vita to help calm him down. In the middle of that call, Vita returned his call and said she was good and fine. Zwan lightly explained how he felt during that moment and told her he would call her again the next night. After I finished the talk with her, I sat and thought for a long time. She had mentioned that she saw the call while talking to her parents and then went for food. I won’t say that’s wrong — it's understandable. But the Vita from a month ago would have been so excited for calls that, at any moment, even during her busiest times, she would’ve immediately called back or at least messaged to say she’d return after food. This time, that emotion, that eagerness — it just wasn’t there. That’s when I truly understood how deeply I had become attached to her, and how much things had changed without either of us fully acknowledging it.",9/15/2024,Zwan's Travel Back,Zwan's Panic,
"On September 16, 2024, Monday, Zwan waited until Vita’s shift ended at 11:30 p.m. to talk to her. He shared what he had been feeling the previous night and explained that he was planning to distance himself from WhatsApp and Instagram, as those platforms were filled with memories and emotional attachments tied to her. His intention wasn’t to hurt her; rather, he understood that she had already moved to a space where emotional attachment had begun to fade. When he conveyed this to her, Vita simply responded with a quiet “okay,” and that was it. On September 16, 2024, Zwan waited until 11:30 PM just to talk. He didn’t know what to say or how to say it. If his words had hurt Vita, he truly felt sorry. She had done nothing wrong — it was entirely Zwan’s emotions. He had already told her that he was emotionally weak in some aspects. Though he had suggested they take a small break and keep some distance, he knew it wouldn’t happen overnight. So, that night, Zwan began writing this journal — one he started for himself, but with the hope of eventually giving it to her on her birthday. He didn’t know when he would finish it, or how long it would become, but once complete, he planned to present it to Vita.

Unexpectedly, around 2:30 PM, he received a missed call from her. He called back, and she told him she was going home and had just booked the ticket — something he had alluded to back on page 2 of his journal. That moment made Zwan realize that perhaps what he had said earlier — about maintaining distance — had been a mistake. Wanting to see her off, he went to the bus stand. There, he gently asked her, “Was what I said the reason you're going home?” Though Vita replied no, the look on her face told him otherwise. She had originally planned to stay home for two weeks but couldn’t get work-from-home approval from her manager. Even though he was trying to remain offline, Zwan told her to message him on Instagram after she reached safely.",9/17/2024,Zwan's Open Talk,Vita's Grief,

Seeing no update, he sent her a message asking if she had reached, and she replied that she had. But even in that moment, a realization struck him deeply — he was the only one putting in the effort to check on her, to stay connected. And honestly, he could no longer understand what was truly going on in her mind. Zwan kept checking on Vita daily, just to make sure she was okay. One thought lingered in his mind — it was around the time of her periods, and he wondered if her mood swings might have played a role in how she responded to his words about keeping some distance. Maybe, unknowingly, what he said had affected her emotionally and led her to decide on going home. Since she wasn’t granted two weeks of work-from-home approval, she planned to return on September 21, a Saturday, so she could be back in Chennai by Sunday morning.",9/18/2024,Zwan's Open Talk,Vita's Home Time,

He reached the bus stand between 5:30 and 6:00 in the morning, hoping to catch a glimpse of her as she stepped off the bus. But she wasn’t there. For a moment, he wondered if she hadn’t come at all or if she had taken a different route, possibly via Coimbatore. He messaged her to ask if she had reached safely. Around 9:00 AM, she replied, saying that she had returned with her friends in a car. That was fine — Zwan hadn’t known about the change in plan.What truly mattered to him wasn’t just seeing her; it was asking her something that had been weighing on his mind: did his words about keeping distance come at the wrong time — perhaps during her period mood swings — and push her to leave for home to regain peace? If that were the case, Zwan genuinely wanted to apologize for not being more considerate, especially when he was aware of her emotional state. He had left her a message asking her to call him once she returned from her outing with friends. He waited the entire night for a response, but none came.

While writing, he experienced a wave of mixed emotions—happiness, love, care—but never sadness or anger toward her. The only thought that kept returning to him was this: once he completes the journal, he should show it to Vita and let her read it. Yes, he was writing this for her. He was reliving and cherishing every beautiful moment they had shared. That alone was more than enough for Zwan to remember her for a lifetime.

But by afternoon, Vita informed him that it was Gayu's birthday the next day, and that their meeting might not happen as planned. With that, the plan to meet her — something Zwan had emotionally invested in for weeks — fell apart. Despite the disappointment, Zwan chose to open up. He explained everything that had happened over the last two months — the thoughts, the feelings, the changes. That’s when Vita shared that she had started distancing herself intentionally, just as they had once discussed. Zwan hadn’t realized it, and he accepted it as his own oversight. Still, Zwan wanted to salute what they once shared — the connection, the memories, and most of all, the story that had unfolded between them. So, from 5 to 5:30 PM, he shared his screen via Google Meet and let Vita begin reading the journal as it was digital journal.

That night, Zwan couldn’t sleep properly, managing just two hours of restless rest. At 7:00 a.m. the next morning, he called Vita again.

During the call, Vita revealed something that struck Zwan deeply—she said she didn’t have any friends who had confronted her the way he did, and because of that, she wouldn’t be able to talk to him the same way anymore. Zwan had originally intended to bring closure gently—on her birthday—by saying, ""It Ends with Us"", in a positive, heartfelt manner. But this sudden turn of events changed everything, flipping his plans and emotions upside down.",10/7/2024,Birthday Journal,Negative Closure,
"On October 15 2024, after a week Zwan tried messaging her and asking if she was okay for which Vita replied just ""Yes"".",10/15/2024,Birthday Journal,Message,
"On October 19, 2024, while Zwan was returning from his hometown, he called Vita to ask if they could meet the following day. Vita, however, told him that she was going to visit her sister’s place—something Zwan later realized wasn’t true. Feeling the need to bring clarity and closure to everything that had unfolded between them, Zwan decided to send her the journal he had been writing—the one that had begun with so much hope and was meant as a heartfelt birthday gift. He emailed the journal to her and gently asked her to read it before her birthday—the very occasion around which all the misunderstandings and emotional distance had begun.",10/19/2024,Birthday Journal,Call after Days,
"On October 31 2024 on Vita's Birthday, with confusion to wish her or not an d if wishing call or message after thinking for long time Zwan messaged ""Happy Birthday"" and made a call which she didn't attend at first. Then Vita called back and Zwan wished her. He asked her ""Whether you had read the journal?"" for which she replied ""Yes"" in mild voice.",10/31/2024,Birthday Journal,Vita's Birthday,

"Main Content of the Journal:

 Hey Hai !!! I really doesn’t know what to call you after 9 months, VI or VITA. We haven’t talked about any nick
names la!!? Leave the nick name apart!! Till our April election travel this girl didn’t even know my proper name. “Name ah

So I’ll go with “KANNA” in this note. So,

Hi Vita.....!!!!! A Note for Her

This journal was a new attempt by myself too .... Comic I had made personally, but I did wanted something more different
and memorable. Enakku theriyala, how much u liked this nu ... caz while I was doing this in my free time, my teammates had seen
what I am doing. Not the content, that’s our personal. When they saw the journal I was doing, all liked it but few said the person
who reads might not take this so much, considering those are just events happened. Okay, may be ... But this journal is something
I had handwritten after 6 years, since I had stopped writing my personal diary after college. This journal have given confidence to
write more in the way I thought. Ithu unakku present panratha vida, enakku journaling panrathukkum, this events memory
eppovaachu enakku thonuchuna(inime doubt tha, caz ithu exhuthurappove I felt so happy for those reminiscing memories), but
though thonuchuna eduthu padikkalaame nu tha pannen...
So That’s it... It would definitely ends with us right??!! Though I mentioned previously that the previous page 3 point tonalanu,
but I think that would be better for us la... So after completing writing this I had 2 different thoughts:
1. As 3rd point, I think that the journey that started on a festival day pongal, may be good to be ended on another festival day
Diwali which falls on your birthday. (OR)
2. Why not restart, with me asking “Is the days hectic??” Haha
But I think here point 1 would be good to go right.?

While I write this I don’t know what I told you to meet for today. That all the things would be lie. Na neraya ezhuthirukken
munnadiyum, neraya peruku anuppiyirukken but I haven’t seen their reaction while reading in person. I did really wanted to see
that in your face good or bad, no issue !! But my favourite person reading what I wrote on her and I’m watching it, That’s what I
needed. And the important thing that I wanted to tell is “ I Loved You and still I do and will do always”. Yeah, na ithu varaikkum
unta sonnathe illa, so end aavurappo aachu sollanumnu nenacha vishayam tha. I did have told this to few, even oru valentine’s
daykku en Amma kitteye sonnene, but unmayave pudicha oruthikitte 8 varsham munnadi sollala, at least nadakkaathu therinchum
oru tym unta solrene ... Eeee

Though we know, it would end with us and can’t be together, na intha love ah ipdi tha, love ah panna maatenu ellaam solla
maaten.. Na innum pannuven, enakku avolo pudikkura oruthar en life la varappo kandippa pannuven da ma... Yellaareyum panna tha
seiren, athu koode ippo unta irukkura feeling and emotion koode vantha innum super ah irukkum... Intha end-ah love uh failure nu
ellaam sollave maaten, caz as I mentioned above “I will always do love” but innoruthar partner ah varappo I will do love that
person more avolotha, un mela ippo irukkurathu kammi aavaathu... “Unloving You is impossible”, caz unloving means should hate you.
To hate you, you must had hurt me ... Antha Mari onnum nadakkave illaye, and nadakkavum seyyaathu ... Sila varutham mattum, caz
of the void of ur absence... athu vitta intha maari knjm journaling antha tymla pannaale sari aayirum ... Aayiruchune sollalaam

Before ending, Why I liked you so much?? itha theriyanum la ... Okay na solren, sollaama epdi porathu ... It’s not coz of your
voice I would always say ..!! It’s because of the excitement I see in your face and the time you had kept aside for me in those
days. The excitement I could see, in your face from, “Is the day hectic”, to even now when we are meeting. And secondly the time,
there are people who have kept their time for me at times, but what made you special is that you had made me as your daily
routine!! That would be special for everyone right?? I started understanding this when I started missing you..!! Yeah !! “I missed
you, I do now and will miss you too”. Also I forget to mention the Raayan song, “Usure Nee Thane” you had made me hear... . At
any point if you had felt something bad from me, in my talks or actions, I am sorry.

I was totally excited and blushed, when you had mentioned will I come trip with you... Naanum annaikku sonnen okay India
Kuala na try pannalaamnu ... but though you had told that solo trip ponum, together nu, at least to Pondy nu ... At that time even
I had planned okay, at least Pondy aachu nearby to ur birthday or my birthday weekend polaamnu ... But now, I understand that
won’t be possible at all....!!

Intha last 2 pages totally MY POV tha... Nothing issues from your side, marupadiyum api nenachu oorukku
kelambiraatha ... Na emotional ah attach aayittenaa knjm veliya vara time edukkum, athu yaara irunthaalum sari ...
emotional fear and weakness eppovume irukkura payyan tha naan .. athanaala tha ntha voidness oru maari ah
irunthuchu... appapo nadakkurathunaala pazhagiduchu ... athanaala tha na eppovum unta solluven, 2 yearsku aprm ah
oruthar ivolo close aavureenga nu.... Naanum puthusa yaareyum intha 2yrs la close aava vittathu illa caz of same fear ...
but inga antha Mari nadanthuchu avolotha ... ippo ithellaam naa pesunappo I feel good avolotha .... Discussion is what
any relationship needs... When I write this and you read all this .. It’s like something discussed ... Ithellaam read pantu
ungalkum ethaathu solrathukku irukkumla athum sollunga ...!!

I have told u la, ithukku munnadiyum sila pera pudichirunthathu nu ellaam, crush nu ellaam ... athellaam pudikka
start panrappove vena nu othunguven ... caz avanga ellaam mostly yearly once meet para Mari iruthuchu ... But You!!??
From election to today till I write we have travelled 2 times to home and 3 times from home, also met 3 times in
Chennai and 5 times boarding you from Bus stand ... This is like meeting each other once in 2 weeks ...!! That’s not
something have happened to me with someone ... And so I was not able to abruptly stop all this .... A proper closure is
what it is needed for a good ending la ...

Etho ORU reel anuppunappo nee sonniyee ORU payyan datelaam niyabagam vechu ovvoru events sonna
nallaarkumnu, epdi irunthuchu ....? Aprm enakku onnu theriyanum before reading last section “Why did/What did you
like me in most???”...

Though now I will little rephrase what Atlas had told Lilly, “At any point of time if you wanna a shoulder to lean,
person to laugh together with, smile at your smile and talk more than 6 hours to show ur excitement, Do consider me...
You are currently my most favourite person, and alway will be one of my favourite person who had given beautiful
memories of my life and how love should be”. Mainly Advance #Happy26 Happy Birthday to You!! Once again that
important thing, Love You !!, - It stops here. With me and you. It Ends With US!!
